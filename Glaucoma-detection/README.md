## Features

- **Image Processing**: Efficient preprocessing of eye images, including resizing and normalization.
- **Classification**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify images as 'Glaucoma' or 'Normal'.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual feedback on the processing stages and results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation and understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing the image processing and classification algorithms.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results and processed data.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/glaucoma-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd glaucoma-detection
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure you have the dataset**: Place the images in the appropriate directories as specified in the project documentation.

## Usage

1. Run the preprocessing script to prepare your dataset:
   ```bash
   python dataset.py
   ```

2. Execute the main script to classify images:
   ```bash
   python classify.py
   ```

3. View the results and visualizations generated by the application.

## How It Works

The Glaucoma Detection project utilizes image analysis techniques to identify potential signs of glaucoma. The process involves:

1. **Image Acquisition**: Collecting eye images for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, converted to grayscale, and normalized to ensure consistency.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the images using OpenCV.
4. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on labeled data (glaucoma vs. normal).
5. **Classification**: The trained model is used to classify new images and provide results.
