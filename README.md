# Glaucoma Detection using Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

This project explores the use of image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for glaucoma detection via retinal image analysis. It leverages feature extraction methods (Cup-to-Disk Ratio (CDR) and Rim-to-Disk Ratio (RDR)) alongside models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for glaucoma classification.

## Overview

- **Image Processing**: Preprocessing and feature extraction (CDR, RDR) from retinal images.
- **Machine Learning**: Classification with KNN, SVM, and Decision Trees.
- **Deep Learning**: Classification using the VGG-16 CNN model.
- **Dataset**: Bin Rushed dataset (or your preferred dataset) for glaucoma detection.

## Glaucoma Detection Project Structure

This project explores the use of image processing, machine learning, and deep learning for glaucoma detection from retinal images.

The provided structure offers different functionalities within the project:

## Directories

- **.venv (Optional)**: This directory represents a virtual environment created to isolate project dependencies.
- **dataset_directory**: This folder likely holds the dataset used for training and testing models (glaucoma and normal images).
- **templates (Optional)**: This directory might contain templates for web applications or visualizations (if applicable).
- **app.py (Optional)**: This file could be a web application entry point (depending on project scope).

## Project Files

- **dataset.py & dataset1.py**: These scripts likely handle the data preprocessing tasks, like resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
- **dl.py, DLmodel.py & ds.py**: These files might be related to deep learning functionality, including model architecture definition or data loading utilities.
- **evaluation.py**: This script likely evaluates the trained models on a test set, providing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- **ex.py**: This file's purpose is unclear but could be used for running experiments or demonstrations.
- **featureextraction&softcomputin...**: This long filename suggests a script for extracting features (e.g., CDR/RDR) and using them for soft computing tasks (possibly related to machine learning models).
- **get-pip.py (Optional)**: This script might be a utility for installing Python packages (outdated practice, consider requirements.txt).
- **image-preprocessing.py**: This script potentially performs additional image preprocessing tasks beyond what's done in dataset.py.
- **image1.jpg (Example)**: This is likely an example image included for reference or testing purposes.
- **modeltraining.py**: This script is crucial for training the glaucoma detection models (machine learning or deep learning).
- **my_model.h5, my_model.keras & my_model.txt**: These files likely represent a trained model (HDF5 file format), its Keras configuration, and potentially additional model information.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the required Python libraries for running the project. This enables easy dependency management by others using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Prerequisites

### Libraries & Tools

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (latest stable version)
- **OpenCV**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Here's an example using `venv`:

      
      python -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
      env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

## Requirements Installation

To install the required libraries for this project, ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory. Then, run the following command:

If you are using a virtual environment, activate it first. Then, install the dependencies:

      
        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Download and Organize the Dataset**

   Download the Bin Rushed dataset (or your preferred glaucoma dataset) containing labeled images (glaucoma and normal). Organize the dataset into separate folders (e.g., `Glaucoma/` and `Normal/`) within your project directory.

2. **Run Data Preprocessing**

   This script resizes, converts images to grayscale, and normalizes them for model training.

       
       python dataset.py
### 3. Train the Machine Learning Models

- **Train the KNN model:**

  ```
     python train_knn.py



### 4. Train the VGG-16 Model

      ```
      python train_vgg16.py
### 5. Evaluate Performance

This script assesses the trained models' accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics using a dedicated test set.

      ```
      python evaluate_model.py
### 6. Make Predictions on New Images

Use the trained models to predict the presence of glaucoma in new images. Here's an example with the KNN model:

      ```
      python predict.py --image "path/to/your/image.jpg"
